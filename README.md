# 4.-Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz

# Purpose
This is a timed coding quiz that utilizes JavaScript fundamentals to store high scores, allowing users to gauge their progress. HTML is used to markup the structure and CSS to style content. Specific criteria for the code quiz include a start button which starts the quiz with a countdown timer upon selection, and for each incorrectly answered question to subtract time from the time remaining. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over and the user may save their initials and score. In the future, we may look into reworking local storage to accomodate more user inputs.

# Usage
1. Open the Code Quiz URL in your browser.
2. Complete the quiz and save your initials and score by clicking the "Start" button and following the prompts.

# Built With
